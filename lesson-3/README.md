# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

**JavaScript** and **Java** are entirely different programming languages.

## JavaScript Pros and Cons

First of all, in terms of syntaxis, JavaScript will feel familiar to you if you already have any knowledge on C, C++ or even C#. Function (method) declaration is very similar, as well as conditional and loop statements and even the logic operators like **&&, ==, !=**, etc.

One of the bases of **JavaScritpt** is the lack of **types**. You will probably be familiar with **types** if you have programming experience. If not, is a way to reserving memory for the information that we are going to store. Depending on the **type** of information that we are storing, is how much memory will use. Also, the **types** are used for confirming that some piece of information, is the one we are expecting. Some well-known **types** in the programming world are:

- int (integer, represents a number)
- float (precision number)
- char (represents a character)
- string (represents a group of characters)
