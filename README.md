# Frontend Course

Web and mobile development are some of the industries with some of the widest presence in the current job market. No matter your professional career, if you probe your knowledge on web development, is highly probable that you will get yourself a well-paid job. Web and mobile development is divided into two main different areas (there are many and more):

- Frontend (what the user can see, like windows, buttons, texts, colors).
