# CSS

[**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or other markup languages (non relevant to this course). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen. In simple words: HTML provides document structure and CSS provides styles for such structure.

## CSS Insertion

In order to use the different styling and layout properties that CSS provide us, we have to reference our CSS code in our HTML code. For this matter, we have different ways to do it:

- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS
